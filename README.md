# Is It Safe to Drive? — Predicting Accident Severity from Weather & Road Conditions

This project explores whether deep learning models can predict vehicle accident severity using historical U.S. accident and weather data. We build a baseline feed-forward neural network (FFNN) to classify accidents as low severity (1–2) or high severity (3–4) using environmental and temporal features such as visibility, temperature, precipitation, weather condition, and time of day.
